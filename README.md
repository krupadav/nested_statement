# nested_statemet 
Nested statements are conditional statement within condition
This is useful when we need to execute a condition based on another condition 
Here the most important thing to keep in mind is that we can write as many 'if' as we want to within 'if' once we start loop of 'elif' we can not use if 
That is efif follows if but 'if' does not follow 'elif'
